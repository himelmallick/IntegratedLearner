Description: IntegratedLearner provides an integrated machine learning
    framework to (1) consolidate predictions by borrowing information across
    several longitudinal and cross-sectional omics data layers, (2) decipher
    the mechanistic role of individual omics features that can potentially
    lead to new sets of testable hypotheses, and (3) quantify uncertainty of
    the integration process. Three types of integration paradigms are
    supported; early, late, and intermediate. The software includes multiple
    ML models based on the SuperLearner R package as well as several data
    exploration capabilities and visualization modules in a unified
    estimation framework.
